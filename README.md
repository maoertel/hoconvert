# {hocon:vert}

CLI Tool to convert `HOCON` into valid `JSON` or `YAML`.

Under normal circumstances this is mostly not needed because hocon configs are parsed 
within the application â€“ case closed. But for example in conjunction with Kubernetes 
where `.conf` files can reside in `ConfigMaps` there was that need to extract information 
on command line from time to time. And what would be more comfortable than to use `jq` 
for this.   

## Usage

```bash
hoconvert [input | --file <path>] [--output (yaml|json)]
```

Either provide the hocon as first argument:

```bash 
hoconvert "foo = bar"
```

or provide it from `stdin`, 

```bash
echo "foo = bar" | hoconvert
``` 

which leads to the following output:

```json
{
  "foo": "bar"
}
```

You can also read the hocon from a file by providing the path:

```bash
hoconvert -f config.hocon
```

Here is an example of a real-life Kubernetes problem as stated above:

```bash
kubectl get cm <any ConfigMap> -o jsonpath='{.data.myHocon}' | jq -r | hoconvert | jq '.doWhatEverYouWant'
```
